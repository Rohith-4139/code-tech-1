OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT
Overview of the Basic Calculator Project
This project is a simple console-based program that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. Here's a high-level overview:
Purpose:
To demonstrate foundational programming concepts such as:

Accepting user input.
Performing calculations.
Using conditional statements to determine the desired operation.
Displaying results.
Features:
User Input:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Prompt the user to choose a mathematical operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Operations:

Perform the chosen operation based on user input.
Handle different operations like:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/).
Error Handling:

Ensure valid numerical input.
Handle division by zero gracefully (e.g., provide a meaningful error message).
Output:

Display the result of the operation in a clear format.
Steps to Implement:
Display instructions to the user.
Accept input for two numbers.
Prompt the user to select an operation (e.g., via symbols or a menu).
Use if-elif-else or a similar structure to decide the operation.
Perform the calculation and display the result.
Handle errors such as invalid inputs or division by zero.
Example Execution:
Input: Enter first number: 10
Input: Enter second number: 5
Input: Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): +
Output: Result: 15
This project is straightforward and a great starting point for beginners to learn basic Python programming.
